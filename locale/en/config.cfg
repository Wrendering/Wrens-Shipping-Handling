basic-boat=In manual mode, drive it like a car! In automated mode, the boat will automatically approach the nearest lighthouse that's transmitting the same signal as the boat, stopping within a certain range of the lighthouse to be guided the rest of the way by buoys.
buoy-entity=Once a boat has reached within the range of a lighthouse, it relies on buoys to be directed further.
lighthouse-entity=Give the lighthouse a signal, and automated boats from anywhere will approach to within a certain distance of the lighthouse. Set one up in your shipping ports to guide boats to and fro!
